          <h1>Who We Serve</h1>
          <p>
            Our services are for the well-qualified buyer with management experience and sufficient capital to
            purchase and manage a small or mid-sized business. Our clients hire us because they do not want to
            become experts at finding and buying businesses. Our clients seek businesses with &quot;upside potential&quot;
            where they can apply their skills, experience, and interests to grow an already profitable, healthy
            business.
