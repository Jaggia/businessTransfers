          <h1>Why Hire Us?</h1>
          <p>
            Acquiring a business is a crucial process - one where you cannot afford to make mistakes. It takes many
            transactions to know where the pitfalls can occur and how to avoid them. Our clients do not want to
            become experts at finding and buying businesses - they want quickly acquire a great business and then
            apply their management skills.
            Many times, our clients come to us after looking for a suitable acquisition target for over a year, to no
            avail. They have wasted considerable time and money.

              Did you know that only 15% of the businesses sold each year advertised their business for sale in the public market?
            </li>
            <li>
              Do you know how to access the other 85%?
            </li>
          </ul>

          We do – it’s our specialty! And, we don&#39;t just uncover a few acquisition targets - we uncover many.
          It is not uncommon for our clients to look at dozens of companies - companies that meet their exact
          acquisition criteria. Our lead generation system allows our clients to spend the majority of their time
          screening and analyzing, not searching. Very often, our client is the only buyer talking to the business
          seller.
          Bottom line - Our clients find more businesses, find them faster and get a better deal with us on their
          team versus going it alone!
